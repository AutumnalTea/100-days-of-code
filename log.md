### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 0 : December 20 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I started on an idea for a gift ideas tracker, realized I didn't know enough Javascript to do what I want and am rusty on Html and CSS so I continued the projects on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**I'm excited to start to code again. I got a little frustrated when I tried to google how to access a js object property through html and kept getting general js object information. I need to keep going through the tutorials on FreeCodeCamp, just outside the one hour of coding a day slot (unless I'm having a bad day and it the maximum I can manage).

### Day 1 : December 21 2020, Monday 

**Today's Progress**: Continued the Product Landing Page, relearning Html and Css as I go. Managed to find how to get ride of the hyperlink underline (text-decoration: none;). This morning I did half an hour of JS exercices (not counted towards this challenge) on regular expressions.

**Thoughts:** It took a lot of herding my brain sheep to get to coding, might be better to do my hour of coding *before* exercices. Had to finish before 18h to attend zoom presentation and started coding at 16h30. Typical. The regular expressions will be useful for my Gift Ideas Tracker in checking if a name is already there before creating a gift list.

### Day 2 : December 22 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Very stressful day and didn't have a lot of time in front of computer, so I did one hour of exercices and that counts for today.

**Thoughts:** Could not get around to coding with the repair of the plumbing issue, being able to switch to one hour exercices when needed helps me stay motivated to continue since I haven't failed yet. Helps with my general mental health as well. It makes sense to only challenge myself on days I'm not a wreck most of the day. I might pause the challenge if I end up only doing exercices too many times in a row if I'm in a mental slump but if it's only once in a while I think it still fits the challenge.

### Day 3 : December 23 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Spent the hour getting my head around CSS Flexbox, got basically want I wanted and then what I needed. 

**Thoughts:**  Is there no way to have a navbar that stays at the top while staying in the flow of the flexbox page ? 'Cause position: fixed gets the thing out of it. At least you can still use Flexbox on its content.
