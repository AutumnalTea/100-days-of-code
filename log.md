##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 0 : December 20 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I started on an idea for a gift ideas tracker, realized I didn't know enough Javascript to do what I want and am rusty on Html and CSS so I continued the projects on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**I'm excited to start to code again. I got a little frustrated when I tried to google how to access a js object property through html and kept getting general js object information. I need to keep going through the tutorials on FreeCodeCamp, just outside the one hour of coding a day slot (unless I'm having a bad day and it the maximum I can manage).

### Day 1 : December 21 2020, Monday 

**Today's Progress**: Continued the Product Landing Page, relearning Html and Css as I go. Managed to find how to get ride of the hyperlink underline (text-decoration: none;). This morning I did half an hour of JS exercices (not counted towards this challenge) on regular expressions.

**Thoughts:** It took a lot of herding my brain sheep to get to coding, might be better to do my hour of coding *before* exercices. Had to finish before 18h to attend zoom presentation and started coding at 16h30. Typical. The regular expressions will be useful for my Gift Ideas Tracker in checking if a name is already there before creating a gift list.
