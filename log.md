# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 0 : December 20 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I started on an idea for a gift ideas tracker, realized I didn't know enough Javascript to do what I want and am rusty on Html and CSS so I continued the projects on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**I'm excited to start to code again. I got a little frustrated when I tried to google how to access a js object property through html and kept getting general js object information. I need to keep going through the tutorials on FreeCodeCamp, just outside the one hour of coding a day slot (unless I'm having a bad day and it the maximum I can manage).
