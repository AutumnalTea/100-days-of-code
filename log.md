### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 0 : December 20 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I started on an idea for a gift ideas tracker, realized I didn't know enough Javascript to do what I want and am rusty on Html and CSS so I continued the projects on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**I'm excited to start to code again. I got a little frustrated when I tried to google how to access a js object property through html and kept getting general js object information. I need to keep going through the tutorials on FreeCodeCamp, just outside the one hour of coding a day slot (unless I'm having a bad day and it the maximum I can manage).

### Day 1 : December 21 2020, Monday 

**Today's Progress**: Continued the Product Landing Page, relearning Html and Css as I go. Managed to find how to get ride of the hyperlink underline (text-decoration: none;). This morning I did half an hour of JS exercices (not counted towards this challenge) on regular expressions.

**Thoughts:** It took a lot of herding my brain sheep to get to coding, might be better to do my hour of coding *before* exercices. Had to finish before 18h to attend zoom presentation and started coding at 16h30. Typical. The regular expressions will be useful for my Gift Ideas Tracker in checking if a name is already there before creating a gift list.

### Day 2 : December 22 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Very stressful day and didn't have a lot of time in front of computer, so I did one hour of exercices and that counts for today.

**Thoughts:** Could not get around to coding with the repair of the plumbing issue, being able to switch to one hour exercices when needed helps me stay motivated to continue since I haven't failed yet. Helps with my general mental health as well. It makes sense to only challenge myself on days I'm not a wreck most of the day. I might pause the challenge if I end up only doing exercices too many times in a row if I'm in a mental slump but if it's only once in a while I think it still fits the challenge.

### Day 3 : December 23 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Spent the hour getting my head around CSS Flexbox, got basically want I wanted and then what I needed. 

**Thoughts:**  Is there no way to have a navbar that stays at the top while staying in the flow of the flexbox page ? 'Cause position: fixed gets the thing out of it. At least you can still use Flexbox on its content.

### Day 4 : December 24 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: "Managed" to embed a youtube video, only to discover the Framekiller technique they use when I couldn't figure out why it wasn't working. I've almost done all the user stories but want to still polish afterwards.

**Thoughts:** Bastards. They give you code to put the youtube video on a page only to fuck with the video playing on said page afterwards. Double faced bastards. I took all day to motivate myself to code and ended up coding an hour and twenty minutes in the end. It was worth it, I had fun.

### Day 5 : December 25 2020, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the product landing page ! I had a hard time with media queries, will need to revisit them to master them. I'm pretty proud of myself for sticking with this challenge and seeing the project to the end.

**Thoughts:**  Again, had a hard time convincing myself to code up until I just started, and then had fun. A good distraction from thinking about my family. I'm genuinly proud of myself and can't wait to show Théo.

### Day 6 : December 26 2020, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I started the next FreeCodeCamp projects, the Technical Documentation Page. It will be about HTML.

**Thoughts:**  I feel awkward about HTML as a subject, which is probably why it's a good idea. I got kind of bored though and am not overjoyed at having to write it so we'll see.

### Day 7 : December 28 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Continued the technical document, wrote a few of the paragraphs then wrestled with flexbox again to get my desired nav-bar. Not quite there yet.

**Thoughts:**  Missed a day yesterday, was alone and very emotional and agitated. Got my period this morning, in hindsight explains it. I keep procrastinating until one in the morning, I need to start earlier... I am still bored by subject but still think it's a good exercice in figuring out how to explain things. I wish finding the right words didn't feel like running in circles or having the ghost of a word in your mouth.

### Day 8 : December 29 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Kept arranging the appearance of the page.

**Thoughts:**  Managed to not code at one in the morning but still quite late (20h ish). Spent the day telling myself I was about to go do it, is this the earliest I was mentally ready for it ? I might try and mentally prepare myself to code tommorrow morning and see if I can code earlier.

Got demotivated until 8th of January.
