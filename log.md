### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 0 : December 20 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I started on an idea for a gift ideas tracker, realized I didn't know enough Javascript to do what I want and am rusty on Html and CSS so I continued the projects on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**I'm excited to start to code again. I got a little frustrated when I tried to google how to access a js object property through html and kept getting general js object information. I need to keep going through the tutorials on FreeCodeCamp, just outside the one hour of coding a day slot (unless I'm having a bad day and it the maximum I can manage).

### Day 1 : December 21 2020, Monday 

**Today's Progress**: Continued the Product Landing Page, relearning Html and Css as I go. Managed to find how to get ride of the hyperlink underline (text-decoration: none;). This morning I did half an hour of JS exercices (not counted towards this challenge) on regular expressions.

**Thoughts:** It took a lot of herding my brain sheep to get to coding, might be better to do my hour of coding *before* exercices. Had to finish before 18h to attend zoom presentation and started coding at 16h30. Typical. The regular expressions will be useful for my Gift Ideas Tracker in checking if a name is already there before creating a gift list.

### Day 2 : December 22 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Very stressful day and didn't have a lot of time in front of computer, so I did one hour of exercices and that counts for today.

**Thoughts:** Could not get around to coding with the repair of the plumbing issue, being able to switch to one hour exercices when needed helps me stay motivated to continue since I haven't failed yet. Helps with my general mental health as well. It makes sense to only challenge myself on days I'm not a wreck most of the day. I might pause the challenge if I end up only doing exercices too many times in a row if I'm in a mental slump but if it's only once in a while I think it still fits the challenge.

### Day 3 : December 23 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Spent the hour getting my head around CSS Flexbox, got basically want I wanted and then what I needed. 

**Thoughts:**  Is there no way to have a navbar that stays at the top while staying in the flow of the flexbox page ? 'Cause position: fixed gets the thing out of it. At least you can still use Flexbox on its content.

### Day 4 : December 24 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: "Managed" to embed a youtube video, only to discover the Framekiller technique they use when I couldn't figure out why it wasn't working. I've almost done all the user stories but want to still polish afterwards.

**Thoughts:** Bastards. They give you code to put the youtube video on a page only to fuck with the video playing on said page afterwards. Double faced bastards. I took all day to motivate myself to code and ended up coding an hour and twenty minutes in the end. It was worth it, I had fun.

### Day 5 : December 25 2020, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the product landing page ! I had a hard time with media queries, will need to revisit them to master them. I'm pretty proud of myself for sticking with this challenge and seeing the project to the end.

**Thoughts:**  Again, had a hard time convincing myself to code up until I just started, and then had fun. A good distraction from thinking about my family. I'm genuinly proud of myself and can't wait to show Théo.

### Day 6 : December 26 2020, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I started the next FreeCodeCamp projects, the Technical Documentation Page. It will be about HTML.

**Thoughts:**  I feel awkward about HTML as a subject, which is probably why it's a good idea. I got kind of bored though and am not overjoyed at having to write it so we'll see.

### Day 7 : December 28 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Continued the technical document, wrote a few of the paragraphs then wrestled with flexbox again to get my desired nav-bar. Not quite there yet.

**Thoughts:**  Missed a day yesterday, was alone and very emotional and agitated. Got my period this morning, in hindsight explains it. I keep procrastinating until one in the morning, I need to start earlier... I am still bored by subject but still think it's a good exercice in figuring out how to explain things. I wish finding the right words didn't feel like running in circles or having the ghost of a word in your mouth.

### Day 8 : December 29 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Kept arranging the appearance of the page.

**Thoughts:**  Managed to not code at one in the morning but still quite late (20h ish). Spent the day telling myself I was about to go do it, is this the earliest I was mentally ready for it ? I might try and mentally prepare myself to code tommorrow morning and see if I can code earlier.

Got demotivated until 8th of January.

### Day 9 : January 8 2021, Friday

**Today's Progress**: CodingGames is a good place to code gamefied, I've worked on the length of cable problem since yesterday. Had to relearn how to find the median but it still didn't work for some. Solved for when only one point. Went looking at the forum, and realised I never sorted my Y list.... Am still figuring out how to do that.

**Thoughts:**  Felt really anti-social and bad these last days, I feel unmotivated by the technical documentation page so I'll take a break or do half and half. Set up my Internet page to minimise distraction.

### Day 10 : January 9 2021, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Used .sort((a,b) => a-b) to sort my list but it didn't pass the test for big numbers so I spent an hour relearning quicksort.

**Thoughts:**  Got my hour finished in the morning which is nice. Was happy that my algorithm passed all basic tests but confused as to why it didn't pass the more advanced ones. Via forum understood why, my sorting method had a complexity of O(n²) which is bad. Looked up quicksort (with a complexity of O(log(n))) and vaguely remembered it. I spent most of the hour reading up and starting to implement it. A lot of explenations weren't clear to me until I found one that used right lists and left lists (which is how it was explained in uni).

### Day 11 : January 10 2021, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Still sorting my quicksort. Works but is too slow for the last test.

**Thoughts:**  I'm enjoying this and it's making me see how unefficient my code is. I feel like I'm progressing as a coder and while I still have trouble starting the hour I don't have much trouble once I've started.
